Meta has maintained net zero GHG emissions in our global operations since 2020. In 2023, 18 operational water restoration projects returned more than 1.5 billion gallons of water to high and medium water stress regions. Our portfolio of more than 11,700 megawatts (MW) of contracted renewable energy makes Meta one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy globally. We are committed to becoming water positive in 2030, which means restoring 200% of the water we consume in high water stress areas, and 100% of the water we consume in medium water stress areas. In our data centers, 90% of construction waste was recycled in 2023.
