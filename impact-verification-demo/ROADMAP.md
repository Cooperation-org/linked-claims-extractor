# LinkedClaims Impact Verification - Product Roadmap

## Vision
Transform organizational impact reports into verified trust through real human validation from actual beneficiaries.

## Core Value Proposition
**"Your impact, verified by the people you've impacted"**

Not AI-verified. Not blockchain-verified. **Human-verified** by the real people who received help.

## User Journey

### 1. Upload & Extract
- Organization uploads their annual report (PDF)
- System extracts specific, verifiable claims:
  - "Provided 15,000 meals to 500 families in Phoenix"
  - "Trained 85 healthcare workers in rural Nigeria"
  - "Funded 12 water wells in Kenya serving 3,000 people"

### 2. Review & Select
- Organization reviews extracted claims
- Each claim must be:
  - Specific (who, what, where, when)
  - Verifiable by real people
  - Connected to actual beneficiaries
- Organization selects which claims to seek validation for

### 3. Generate Validation Links
- System creates unique validation links for each claim
- Links are:
  - Mobile-friendly (SMS/WhatsApp compatible)
  - No login required
  - Available in multiple languages
  - Time-limited for security

### 4. Send to Beneficiaries
- Organization sends links to actual beneficiaries:
  - Via SMS to healthcare workers trained
  - Via WhatsApp to community leaders
  - Via email to partner organizations
- Each link is personalized to the specific claim

### 5. Human Validation
- Beneficiaries receive simple validation request:
  - "Did [Organization] provide meals to your community in 2023?"
  - Options: ✓ Yes | ✗ No | ~ Partially
  - Optional: Add comment or testimonial
  - Optional: Upload photo evidence
- One-click validation process
- Works on any device

### 6. Build Trust Score
- Real-time validation tracking:
  - "Validated by 387 of 500 beneficiaries (77%)"
  - Geographic distribution of validations
  - Timeline of validations
- Public trust profile showing:
  - Verified claims with validation rates
