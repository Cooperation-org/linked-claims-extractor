When the inspectors from the dairy board visit our
shop in Maili Nne, they take tests of our milk. Before,
there were some traces of unclean milk, but since I
went through the training, they have come to our shop
around three times. And their tests are proof that our
milk is good.

Our cows have also been more productive because I now
know how to feed them better and make sure they have
water. And I learned that when there is excess milk, there
is added value. I started making mala, a malted milk,
with the excess. No milk is wasted. And I can sell mala in
the shop for 100 shillings per liter, while fresh milk sells
for 70 shillings per liter.
